# Unity AR+GPS Location

The `AR+GPS Location` package brings the ability to position 3D objects in
real-world geographical locations via their GPS coordinates using Unity and
Augmented-Reality. It supports both Unity's `AR Foundation` and `Vuforia`.

It works by mixing both GPS data and the AR tracking done by `AR Foundation` of
`Vuforia`. 

Check the full documentation for the asset [here](http://docs.unity-ar-gps-location.com).

## Main Features
* Place 3D Objects in geographical positions defined by their latitude, longitude and altitude.
* AR Hotspots that are activated when the user is near a given location.
* Place 3D Text markers on real-world points of interest (example using OpenStreetmaps is included.)
* Smooth movements on device location and heading updates.
* Move objects or place them along paths (Catmull-rom splines) on the map.
* Augmented reality floor shadows.
* General purpose Catmull-rom curves and splines.

## Minimum Requirements
* For AR Foundation, a iOS device with ARKit support, or a Android device with ARCore support (see the AR Core device list [here](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices)).
* For Vuforia, a device with ground plane support (see the list of devices [here](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Solution/vuforia-fusion-supported-devices.html))
* The device must have functioning magnetic and GPS sensors.
* For better performance, a working gyroscope is also recommended.

## Limitations

* Altitude information is usually very imprecise so, currently, it's best to use heights relative to the device position or relative to detected ground planes.
* Landscape mode does not work well on may Android devices, due to a problem with tilt-compensation on the magnetic sensor data.
* There are limits due to the GPS precision. So, on good conditions precision can range from 2 to 5 meters, and on bad conditions from 10 to 20meters.
* Does not work well on indoors.
